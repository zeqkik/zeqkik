## About Me

Hello, I'm Ezequiel. I have a strong interest in data science, machine learning, and software development. I find it fascinating to solve intricate problems through data-driven solutions. My academic background in Control and Automation Engineering has provided me with a solid foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.

## Knowledge and Skills

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Proficient in using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. Experienced with SQL for data extraction and Looker Studio/Power BI for creating interactive dashboards.
- **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**: Skilled in developing machine learning models using Scikit-learn, and deep learning models with Keras and TensorFlow. Experienced in preprocessing data, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **Software Development**: Strong programming skills in Java and Python. Experienced in developing APIs using Flask and working with various development tools and frameworks.
- **Project Management**: Experience in managing product backlogs, prioritizing tasks, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software solutions.

## Projects

Here are a few highlights of my projects:

- **Prediction Model for Combustion Engines**: Developed a prediction model using AI algorithms for combustion engines with an intelligent injection system. Implemented data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, neural network development, and hyperparameter optimization.
- **5G Network Simulation**: Worked on a 5G network simulation project focusing on predicting Quality of Experience (QoE) and Quality of Service (QoS) using machine learning algorithms.
- **ETL Processes and Data Visualization**: Implemented ETL processes to extract, clean, and prepare data for analysis. Created interactive dashboards using Looker Studio and Power BI to support data-driven decision-making.
